# # Task 1: Dictionary, Set and Tuple
# # # Given the following three scenarios, choose the best data structure (between a dictionary, set, or tuple) to efficiently store the data. Each scenario ties directly to one data structure. Each data structure will be used only once. You will need to determine which data structure is best for which scenario, and then implement the data structure in Python.
# # # 1. Store the months of the year as strings. Determine the month in the data structure in which National Pi Day exists and print that month to the console. 
# # # 1. HINT: The number for Pi, when converted to an Integer, is related to the stored location of the correct month.
# # 2. Store five fruits or vegetables.
# # 1. Add two of your favorite fruits and two of your favorite vegetables to the collection.
# # 2. Iterate over the collection and print each one to the console. 
# # 3. Store information about a user profile. Use literal string interpolation to print the user’s profile information to the console. The profile should consist of the following information:
# # 1. First Name
# # 2. Last Name
# # 3. Email Address
# # 4. Phone Number


# # Helpful Hint:
# # For more information on “string interpolation” refer to this article:
# # There are at least 6 different ways to do this.

# # Task 2: List of Dictionaries
# # Use a list to store the dictionary of your immediate family members, with each index of the list storing its own dictionary. Dictionary should contain the following keys:
# # First name
# # Last name
# # Relation to you

# # Once you have stored the List of Dictionary items, write a function/method that will iterate over the List and print off the First Name and Relation of each person in the List.
